          <p class="section-content">A lot of people "tinker" with CSS. In this module, we'll take you from the very basics of CSS3 to some fairly advanced concepts like floating and CSS rule conflict resolution. We'll go over the 'box model', background property, etc. We'll finish off the module with learning about Responsive Design using our own CSS code as well as start introducing Twitter Bootstrap with its essential Grid System.<br>

          <p class="section-content">What fun would a web site be if there were no functionality to it. In this module, we'll go over Javascript language basics, understand how some of the fundamentals work, and move on to one of the most popular ways of serving up data to a site - Ajax. We'll learn about the protocol that the language of the way speaks in (HTTP), how to set up and handle Ajax request and responses, as well as how to process JSON data. We'll finish the module by connecting our restaurant web site from Module 3 to a real backend service that will allow us to pull the data for the restaurant menu dynamically from the server without having to reload the entire page.<br>
